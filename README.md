# slackcraft
Connect slack with a minecraft server. Receive notifications in minecraft chat messages, and send messages to channels from there too. (Private messages too!)

#How to set up

1) *Create a bot*. Go into your browser of preference and surf to your team's custom integrations page. URL should be https://<yourteamsname>.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations . In the top search bar search for `Bots`, and click the one with a gray icon. For your teams name, click configure, and then `Add configuration`. You will be asked for a username for your bot, don't be dull please, choose a magic inspiring octocat name :octocat:. You will get a large API Token, keep that in a safe place, you'll need it later. You can also customize the icon, name, channels, etcetera, in this page.

2) *Invite the bot to all the necessary channels* (they can be private channels too) with `/invite @mybotsnamehere`.

3) Load the plugin, simply clone in desktop, run `mvn clean install` on top of it, and there you go with your jar file, which should be found at `~/slackcraft-beta/target/slackcraft-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`. Drop it in your plugins folder and start the server up.

4) When you join the server, you will be approached with a message which you can read if you need help. Now, to connect with the slack bot, do `/slc <thekeyyouhavebeenkeepinginasafeplace>` (and yes, there is enough space in chat box). When you receive the go-ahead message, you can now use all the commands:

  - You can *disconnect* from the slack bot using `/sld`
  - You can *send a message to a channel* with `/slack <channel> <message>`
  - You can *send a private message* with `/pm <user> <message>`

You will also receive notifications in chat (along with a cool sound) if:
  - A message contains your username (your mc name to lowercase by default) (not caps-sensitive)
  - You get pinged.

Your slack username (@username) isn't exactly your minecraft name lowercased? Oh mon deu! Don't worry too much though, you can just use `/slu <newusername, without the @>`
